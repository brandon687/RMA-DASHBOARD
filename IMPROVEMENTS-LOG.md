## Design Philosophy Applied

### Principles from SCal Mobile Brand Analysis

1. **Progressive Scaling**: Larger headlines for hierarchy (like scalmob.com's 48-64px headlines)
2. **Metric-Driven Credibility**: Specific numbers (45-day, 2-day, Sundays)
3. **Dual-Audience Clarity**: Clear distinctions between US and International customers
4. **Scanability**: Numbered cards, clear headings, bullet points in FAQs
5. **Professional Tone**: Active voice, specific details, no ambiguity

### Typography Hierarchy

```
Level 1 (Main Titles):     3rem (48px) - Bold
Level 2 (Card Titles):     1.75rem (28px) - SemiBold
Level 3 (Section Heads):   1.5rem (24px) - SemiBold
Level 4 (Subheadings):     1.375rem (22px) - SemiBold
Body Text:                 1.0625rem (17px) - Regular
Supporting Text:           1rem (16px) - Regular
```

### Color Adjustments

- Info card text: #808080 → #666666 (better readability)
- Footer text: #808080 → #b3b3b3 (better contrast on black)

## Results

### Before
- Text too small and thin
- Generic, unclear copy
- Tuve Inc link causing confusion
- Weak visual hierarchy

### After
- ✓ Bold, readable typography at all screen sizes
- ✓ Clear, action-oriented copy
- ✓ Single-brand focus (SCal Mobile only)
- ✓ Strong visual hierarchy matching scalmob.com
- ✓ Professional B2B tone throughout
- ✓ Metric-driven credibility (45-day, 2-day, Sundays)
- ✓ Scannable content structure

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Mobile devices**: Verify text remains readable on iPhone/Android
2. **Desktop**: Confirm hierarchy is clear at 1920px width
3. **Customer feedback**: Monitor if questions/confusion decreases
4. **Conversion**: Track RMA submission completion rates

## Future Enhancements

- Add font-weight: 500 (Medium) for mid-level emphasis
- Consider dark mode support with adjusted colors
- A/B test different button sizes
- Add subtle micro-animations on card hovers

**All changes align with SCal Mobile's professional B2B aesthetic and improve clarity for customers.**
